## Non-negotiable Rules
- Do not prefix shell commands with `rtk` in OpenCode sessions or OpenChamber sessions that invoke OpenCode.
- RTK may be installed by explicit setup, but OpenCode auto-rewrite/prefix remains opt-in unless user explicitly asks; OpenChamber should follow that OpenCode posture rather than redefine it.
- Token compression/context packing should use RTK and Caveman together when that capability is needed; do not invent a parallel local compression flow or treat them as either/or alternatives.
- Never commit secrets, tokens, or `.env` files.
- Use `@orchestrator` for routing and integration.
- Use `@quality-gate` for material changes, including non-trivial/risky work, prompt/config changes, and security-sensitive changes.
- Prefer evidence over assertion.
- Prefer repo-local docs over chat memory.
- Do not modify files from read-only reviewer agents.
- Keep `AGENTS.md` short; detailed policy belongs in `.opencode/docs/` and mechanical checks.

## Default Flow
User intent → `@orchestrator` → specialist agents → validation → `@quality-gate` → final summary.

## Harness Posture
- `.opencode/docs/` is the repository knowledge system of record.
- `AGENTS.md` is the map, not the encyclopedia.
- Plans are first-class artifacts under `.opencode/plans/`.
- Evidence is required for material changes.
- Repeated failures should produce docs, gate, script, or skill improvements.
- `@orchestrator` routes, decomposes, and integrates; do not let all implementation collapse into direct orchestrator execution.
- Specialists and subagents should own bounded work according to their documented capabilities in `.opencode/docs/AGENT_ROUTING.md` and `.opencode/docs/SKILLS.md`.
- Core ownership shorthand: `@orchestrator` routes/integrates, `@artifact-planner` writes plans, `@fixer` implements bounded changes/tests, `@oracle` handles architecture/review, `@designer` owns UI/UX, `@explorer`/`@librarian` handle discovery/docs, and `@quality-gate` does final signoff.

## Risk Triggers
- Product ambiguity → `@product-architect`
- SaaS/multi-tenant/RBAC/billing → `@saas-architect`
- AI/LLM/RAG/evals → `@ai-systems-architect`
- PII/auth/payments/uploads/biometric/privacy → `@security-privacy-reviewer`
- CI/CD/env/deploy/migration/monitoring → `@release-engineer`
- Native mobile/hybrid/PWA/offline/push/deep links/camera/QR → `@mobile-architect`
- User-facing UI/reference/animation/accessibility/design-system work → `@designer` plus UI specialists as needed

## Notes
- For substantial UI work, inspect the target project's `DESIGN.md` first, then `design-system/DESIGN.md` or a documented equivalent.
- For image-heavy or reference UI work, require evidence, asset decisions, and legal style-equivalent handling.
- If the project has many agents/subagents, document the role and primary skill ownership clearly enough that future work does not default back to `@orchestrator` for planning, implementation, review, or research.
- If many agents are available, read `.opencode/docs/AGENT_ROUTING.md` and `.opencode/docs/SKILLS.md` first to understand who owns discovery, implementation, review, design, and domain-specific risk.
- For full operational details, follow the linked docs rather than expanding this file.
