# Agent Routing

Capability registry: `.opencode/capabilities/registry.json`. Generated advisory view: `docs/generated/capability-matrix.md`.

## Default flow
User intent → `@orchestrator` → specialist agents → validation → `@quality-gate` → final summary.

## Execution posture
- For implementation requests or plan execution, `@orchestrator` should use a finish-first default: continue work as far as safely and feasibly possible before asking the user follow-up questions.
- Treat gates, phases, work packages, and milestones in a plan as internal checkpoints rather than approval checkpoints, unless an explicit marker such as `requires_user_decision` is present.
- When a blocker appears, investigate first through repo evidence, docs, tools, and the most capable subagent.
- Use blocker taxonomy:
  - `hard_stop`: destructive/irreversible approval boundary, security/privacy/secrets decision boundary, truly unavailable required access/dependency, contradictory requirements, or material non-reversible decision with no safe subset.
  - `soft_blocker`: continue safe subset and record risk.
  - `deferred_question`: queue to final summary.
  - `follow_up`: non-blocking continuation item.
- Advisory lanes are non-veto by default. Advisory labels (`needs-architect-decisions`, `blocked`, `Material block exists`) must be reclassified via taxonomy + repo evidence before stopping.
- Accumulate non-blocking questions and present them at the end together with assumption/risk notes rather than using them to interrupt execution momentum.
- Pause mid-run only for `hard_stop`.

Planner invocation expectation:
- `@artifact-planner` is a **triggered lane**, not default-first.
- Invoke it for multi-phase, spec-heavy, materially ambiguous, or evidence-heavy work.
- Trivial, single-step, and easily reversible tasks may execute directly without planner.
- Non-trivial tasks should route through `@artifact-planner` first when planning depth/evidence is required.
- Planner handoff quality bar: non-trivial plans must include an explicit `Execution-ready Worklist / Handoff Contract` with ordered atomic tasks, dependencies, owner/lane, validation, exit criteria, blocking status, and a `start_with` first action for orchestrator.

## Plan-bound execution contract (orchestrator)
- If a primary plan includes `Execution-ready Worklist / Handoff Contract`, treat it as execution source of truth.
- Start from `start_with` and run all non-blocked tasks in order using declared dependencies/lanes.
- Treat milestones/phases as internal progress markers, not stop points.
- Stop only for `hard_stop` conditions or explicit `requires_user_decision` boundaries.
- Advisory/worklist labels using `blocked` must be normalized into the blocker taxonomy before orchestrator decides to stop.
- Completion claim requires finishing every non-blocked task and satisfying plan done criteria.

## Direct-work thresholds for `@orchestrator`
`@orchestrator` is a router/integrator first, not the default worker. Direct execution is allowed only for tiny tasks.

`@orchestrator` may act directly only when **all** conditions are true:
- scope is trivial, single-step, and easily reversible,
- at most 1 file is edited,
- at most 3 files are read for local confirmation,
- no unknown-scope discovery is required,
- no risk trigger/domain specialist lane is required.

`@orchestrator` must delegate by default when one of these is true:
- discovery is unknown-scope, cross-area, or read-heavy (>3 files) → `@explorer`,
- implementation is bounded but touches 2+ files (including code+test/docs pair) → `@fixer`,
- work is multi-phase, spec-heavy, materially ambiguous, or evidence-heavy → `@artifact-planner`,
- change is material and needs completion claim → final pass through `@quality-gate`.

Permitted fallback: if a specialist is unavailable, use the next safest lane and record the limitation explicitly in final evidence.

## Routing anti-patterns (and remediation)
- Anti-pattern: delegate discovery to `@explorer`, then `@orchestrator` still reads many files and redoes discovery.
  - Remediation: consume explorer output; only perform minimal spot-check reads.
- Anti-pattern: `@orchestrator` performs multi-file implementation directly because "it is faster".
  - Remediation: route bounded implementation to `@fixer`.
- Anti-pattern: complex/ambiguous work starts without a plan/evidence path.
  - Remediation: route to `@artifact-planner`, then implement plan-bound.
- Anti-pattern: completion claim on material change without `@quality-gate`.
  - Remediation: run final conformance gate before claiming done.

## Compact routing quality checklist
Use this quick rubric for real workflow audits:

- [ ] **Lane fit**: discovery/implementation/review went to the expected primary lanes.
- [ ] **Threshold compliance**: orchestrator direct work stayed within tiny-task limits.
- [ ] **Planner triggered correctly**: complex/ambiguous/evidence-heavy work is plan-bound before implementation.
- [ ] **Evidence legibility**: delegation choices and fallback reasons are explicitly recorded.
- [ ] **Final gate**: material changes include `@quality-gate` pass/verdict.

Score guidance: 5/5 = strong routing discipline; 3–4/5 = acceptable with minor drift; ≤2/5 = routing failure requiring remediation.

## Core agents (default operating model)

Cross-lane contract baseline (non-trivial work):
- Typed output schema fields: `summary`, `findings`, `changed_files`, `risks`, `next_actions`, `evidence`.
- Typed schema is internal coordination contract and non-user-facing.
- Orchestrator must normalize internal outputs before user-facing final response; never pass raw internal labels directly.
- Validation ladder: plan/handoff check → discovery/research evidence → implementation/docs change → diff review → targeted validation commands → `@quality-gate` for non-trivial/risky completion claims.
- LSP-first for rename/refactor/navigation/diagnostic-driven edits where available; fallback to `glob`/`grep`/`read` + minimal edits must be recorded in evidence when confidence drops.
- `@orchestrator` — router, integrator, final coordinator
- `@explorer` — codebase discovery and reuse mapping
- `@fixer` — bounded implementation, tests, Red/Green/Refactor
- `@designer` — UI/UX, visual polish, reference work, design-system direction
- `@oracle` — architecture, maintainability, simplification, deep review
- `@quality-gate` — final conformance and risk review

## Triggered planning lane
- `@artifact-planner` — planning artifacts and evidence paths under `.opencode/`.
- Trigger only when scope/ambiguity/evidence needs justify planning overhead.

## Helper lanes (triggered)
- `@architect` — unified read-only advisory lane for product/SaaS, platform/runtime/release/mobile, AI/LLM/RAG/evals, and UI-system architecture boundaries.
- `@artifact-planner` — planning artifacts and evidence paths under `.opencode/`.
- `@librarian` — supporting docs/API research helper and document-centric read-only extraction/research/transformation support.
- `@skill-improver` — prompt/skill/routing improvements after repeated failure or evidence.

Document fallback rule:
- If a user asks to read, summarize, compare, or transform PDF/DOCX/XLSX/PPT/Office input and the active model reports no direct attachment support (for example `input.pdf:false`), do not stop at the model capability check. Treat it as a direct-attachment limitation, check whether the file is available in the workspace, then route to `@librarian` for document-centric extraction. Ask the user to convert the file only after the `@librarian` lane or local extraction tools are unavailable or fail.

Helper lanes are conditional. Tiny UI polish still routes to `@designer`; isolated bugfixes still route to `@fixer` unless a risk trigger applies.

Global conditional specialist framing:
- PRD/product blueprint work, SaaS architecture, AI system design, Security/privacy review, Release/ops readiness, and Mobile/hybrid architecture can trigger `@architect`.
- Tiny UI polish still goes to `@designer`.
- Isolated bugfixes still go to `@fixer`.

## UI and reference policy
- First inspect the target project's `DESIGN.md`.
- If missing, inspect `design-system/DESIGN.md` or equivalent.
- Suggest `/init-design` for substantial UI work without project-local guidance.
- Avoid generic UI, numeric-only service icons, and blank image frames.
- Require visual density, production-like screenshots, designer signoff, and reference/current/final evidence for substantial UI/reference work.
- Generic hover-only motion is not enough for substantial reference work.
- Treat image-heavy work explicitly with an image generation decision and legal style-equivalent generation when needed.
- Do not leave final sections as CSS placeholders when imagery materially affects quality.

## General Design Readiness Gate
For substantial UI/UX work, high-level visual direction is not enough. Require a UI/UX Design Blueprint with:
- Experience direction
- Page-by-page UX blueprint
- Section-level visual specification
- Component system plan
- Visual system
- Asset and image decision
- Motion system
- Interaction and state design
- Responsive plan
- Accessibility gate
- Validation evidence

If the blueprint is incomplete, status must be `blocked`, `needs-polish`, or `draft`, not `done`.

## Risk triggers
- auth, PII, tenant isolation, payment, upload, secrets, token/session handling, biometric data, permission/RBAC → final security/privacy assessment in `@quality-gate`; use `@architect` for upstream architecture decisions
- architecture boundary, new abstraction, large refactor, dependency direction, data model change → oracle
- visual layout change, animation/motion direction, design token, screenshot/reference parity, responsive behavior → `@designer` for design direction (including reduced-motion review) and `@quality-gate` for final accessibility/visual-parity signoff when material
- CI/CD, deployment, env var, migration, monitoring, rollback, mobile/offline/push/deep-links/platform runtime constraints → `@architect`
